\chapter*{About the Bibliography}
\pdfbookmark{Bibliography}{bibliography}

Today, plenty of books have been published about Bitcoin. However, most of the
conversation -- and thus most of the resources of interest -- happen online.

\paragraph{}
The following bibliography lists books, papers, and online resources alike. If
the resource has a URL associated with it, the URL was alive and kicking in
October 2019, since I was able to successfully access the resource in question.
If any of the following URLs leads to a dead page, I'm sorry. Please let me
know\footnote{\url{https://dergigi.com/contact}} so I can update the link(s).

\paragraph{}
P.S: Bitcoin and \href{https://ipfs.io/}{IPFS} fixes this.
